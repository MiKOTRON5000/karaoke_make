Make karaoke videos using open source tools 
Using a combination of open-source tools (youtube-dl, ffmpeg, spleeter and yt_whisper) to separate the audio of a music video into its vocal and accompaniment stems, then using yt_whisper to create a lyrics file, and finally using ffmpeg to combine the original video with the accompaniment audio and the lyrics file to create the final music video with the lyrics subtitles and without vocals.
